# wmDevAroundBirth

This code is related to our manuscript titled "Human white matter myelination rate slows down at birth". The manuscript is currently under review. There are three different jupyter notebooks included:
The notebook "mrtrix_pipline" illustrates how we conducted tractography in the dHCP data using tools provided by MRtrix 3.
The notebook "pyBabyAFQ" shows how we identified 20 white matter bundles in individual infants using the newly developed pyBabyAFQ software. PyBabyAFQ is made available as a novel component of pyAFQ (see https://github.com/yeatmanlab/pyAFQ).
The notebook "analyses_for_manuscript_v6" shows how all the main statistical analyses were performed and how the main figures were created.
